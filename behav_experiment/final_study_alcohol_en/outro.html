            Great, you successfully completed the game!
            <br>
            <br>
            Initially, you were informed that you could win a beverage store voucher worth £50 or £15, depending on your performance in this game. We instructed you this way to render our task more realistic and create the impression that the drinks you collect in this game translate to real-world drinks.
            <br>
            In fact, however, we do not give away beverage store vouchers, but instead pay out the bonuses directly via Prolific. The rules for bonus sizes are as we told you initially: If you collected the most glasses among the participants, we will reward you with a bonus payment of £50 and if you were in 2nd to 4th place, we will reward you with a bonus payment of £15 each. If you are one of these best participants, you will receive your bonus directly via Prolific once we finished our study. This way, we hope to not incentivize participants to spend their bonus payments on alcoholic drinks.
            <br>
            Please contact us at b01-studie-berlin@tu-dresden.de if you have any further questions or concerns.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before you return to Prolific, you will be redirected to the final questionnaires. To proceed, please press the right arrow key. Thanks!
