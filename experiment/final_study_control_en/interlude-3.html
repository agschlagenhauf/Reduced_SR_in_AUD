            Great, thanks to your search skills you were again able to enjoy many Friday evenings in the restaurant with friends.
            <br>
            <br>
            As luck would have it, a colleague is now away for a few months and has offered you the opportunity to stay in his house.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the new house, you are again regularly on the lookout for cash in your new secret hiding places on Friday evenings.
            <br>
            <br>
            The same principle applies in the new house: collect as much cash as possible. Memorise where you currently find the most money.
            <br>
            <br>
            Good luck!
