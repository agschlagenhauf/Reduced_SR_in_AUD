                Unfortunately, your favorite restaurant does not accept card payments, which means you need cash.`,

                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                So on Fridays you're regularly faced with the question: where can I quickly find some cash so I can go out for a relaxed meal?`,

                <br>
                <br>
                However, in the hustle and bustle of everyday life, you often forget how much cash you have stored where.
                <br>
                <br>
                On Fridays, you therefore regularly search your house shortly before setting off for the restaurant.`,

                <br>
                <br>
                If you collect the most cash among the participants, we will pay you an additional bonus worth £50. If you are in 2nd to 4th place, we will pay you a bonus of £15 each. The more cash you find throughout the game, the more likely you are to be one of the lucky winners!`,

                <br>
                <br>
                In other rooms, you can only choose ONE option: A specific location (e.g. a shelf) where you search for cash. After you have searched the location, you can see whether and how much money you have found. You then automatically move on to the next room.`,


                `On the first Fridays, we will tell you which option to choose in all rooms. In rooms that actually contain two options, this means that one of the options is grayed out and cannot be selected. The option that you can choose will light up YELLOW.
                <br>
                <br>
                On these first Fridays, please memorise where you find the most cash. How much money you find in a room does not depend on how you got there.`,

                `On the following Fridays, we will give you a free choice: In rooms with two action options, both options are available and marked YELLOW.
                <br>

                On these Fridays, you have the opportunity to collect as much cash as possible for your restaurant visit. Choose the options that lead you to the highest amount of money.`,
