README.md

This code runs the sequential decision-making task used to differentiate model-free, model-based, successor representation and rigid reduced successor representation algorithms. 

This code is used for our pilot study, where participants have to navigate through an apartment to find the places where they previously left money. 

## Task structure

Five conditions:
1) Reward revaluation
2) Transition revaluation
3) Policy revaluation
4) Goal state revaluation
5) Control

Three phases
1) Learning
2) Re-learning
3) Test

## How to run

This code is written for JATOS - to run, jzip the entire pilot folder and import as a new study to JATOS.
