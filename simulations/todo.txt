** full_sr.py is finished, can base other models on it. **

1) For each model
  - Change episode() to run_trial()
  - Change pretraining() to learning()
  - Change retraining() to relearning()
  - Remove update_logs()
  - Remove any references to timestep*
  - Remove any references to epi*
  - Change end_states to just end_state everywhere

2) run_trial()
  - Remove all input arguments and references to *_list (logging_lists, action_list, value_list, etc.)
  - Should now return any updated params and transition_log (transition log is just a list of strings, each one is a line in the csv)

3) learning()
  - Remove all input arguments and references to *_list
  - Should now return new_params, transition_log

4) relearning()
  - Remove all references to *_list
  - Should now return new_params, transition_log
  
5) test()
  - Should now return action (1 or 2) and transition_log (transition log is an array of a single string in this case)

6) For all functions, update doc strings to match style and content of those in full_sr.py
